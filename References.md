## Data Modeling
Getting data modeling right is vital for database performance, but it's a massive topic that varies significantly across database models and types. We reference data modeling throughout the book, but did not feel that adding a dedicated chapter on data modeling would be feasible or adequate. Here are some recommended resources we recommend: 

- [NoSQL Distilled: A Brief Guide to the Emerging World of Polyglot Persistence](https://martinfowler.com/books/nosql.html), a book by Pramod J. Sadalage and Martin Fowler
